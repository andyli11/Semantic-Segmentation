# Semantic Segmentation with PyTorch

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook guides you through the process of training a deep learning model for **semantic segmentation** using PyTorch and torchvision. It covers dataset preparation, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Notebook Contents

### 1️⃣ **Environment Setup**
- Imports required libraries (`torch`, `torchvision`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
- Loads the **Pascal VOC** dataset for segmentation tasks.
- Configures **device settings** (CPU/GPU).

### 2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**
- Applies **image transformations** using `torchvision.transforms`, including:
  - **Resizing**
  - **Random cropping**
  - **Color jittering**
  - **Normalization**
- Loads and visualizes augmented images.

### 3️⃣ **Model Definition**
- Uses a **pretrained deep learning model** from `torchvision.models.segmentation`.
- Modifies the **final classification layer** to match the dataset classes.
- Moves the model to the selected device (CPU/GPU).

### 4️⃣ **Training the Model**
- Defines the **loss function** (`CrossEntropyLoss`).
- Uses the **Adam optimizer** for updating model parameters.
- Implements a **training loop** that:
  - Loads batches of data.
  - Computes loss and gradients.
  - Updates weights.
  - Displays training progress.

### 5️⃣ **Evaluation & Inference**
- Runs the model on the **validation set**.
- Calculates **mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)** for performance evaluation.
- Visualizes predicted segmentation masks compared to ground truth.

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the **setup and data loading** cells.
3. Implement missing parts in the **data augmentation & model training** sections.
4. Train the model and check performance.
5. Save and export results.

## Expected Output
- A trained segmentation model achieving **at least 40% mIoU**.
- Segmentation predictions visualized as overlayed masks.
- A final trained model ready for further improvement or deployment.

## Notes
- Ensure you switch to a **GPU runtime** before training.
- Save model checkpoints to avoid retraining from scratch.
